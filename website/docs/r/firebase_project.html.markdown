# google\_firebase\_project

A Firebase Project is the top-level Firebase entity. It is the container for Firebase Apps, Firebase Hosting sites, storage systems (Firebase Realtime Database, Cloud Firestore, Cloud Storage buckets) and other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) resources.


To get more information about Project, see:

* [API documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/api/reference/rest)
* How-to Guides

## Example Usage - Firebase Project Basic


```hcl
resource "google_firebase_project" "my-firebase-project" {
  project = "my-project-name"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:



- - -


* `resources` -
  (Optional)
  The default resources associated with a FirebaseProject.  Structure is documented below.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.


The `resources` block supports:

* `hosting_site` -
  (Optional)
  The default Firebase Hosting site name, in the format: projectId
  Though rare, your projectId might already be used as the name for an existing Hosting site in another project
  (learn more about creating non-default, additional sites).
  In these cases, your projectId is appended with a hyphen then five alphanumeric characters to create your default Hosting site name.
  For example, if your projectId is myproject123, your default Hosting site name might be: myproject123-a5c1

* `realtime_database_instance` -
  (Optional)
  The default Firebase Realtime Database instance name, in the format: projectId
  Though rare, your projectId might already be used as the name for an existing Realtime Database instance in another project (learn more about database sharding).
  In these cases, your projectId is appended with a hyphen then five alphanumeric characters to create your default Realtime Database instance name.
  For example, if your projectId is myproject123, your default database instance name might be: myproject123-a5c16

* `storage_bucket` -
  (Optional)
  The default Cloud Storage for Firebase storage bucket, in the format: projectId.appspot.com

* `location_id` -
  (Optional)
  The ID of the project's default GCP resource location. The location is one of the available GCP resource locations.
  This field is omitted if the default GCP resource location has not been finalized yet.
  To set your project's default GCP resource location, call defaultLocation.finalize after you add Firebase services to your project.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:


* `name` -
  The fully qualified resource name of the Project, in the format: projects/projectId

* `project_id` -
  Immutable. The globally unique, user-assigned ID of the Project.

* `project_number` -
  The globally unique, Google-assigned identifier of the Project.

* `display_name` -
  The user-assigned display name of the Project.


## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](/docs/configuration/resources.html#timeouts) configuration options:

- `create` - Default is 4 minutes.
- `update` - Default is 4 minutes.
- `delete` - Default is 4 minutes.

## Import

Project can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

```
$ terraform import google_firebase_project.default projects/{{project}}/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_firebase_project.default {{project}}/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_firebase_project.default {{name}}
```

-> If you're importing a resource with beta features, make sure to include `-provider=google-beta`
as an argument so that Terraform uses the correct provider to import your resource.

## User Project Overrides

This resource supports [User Project Overrides](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_reference.html#user_project_override).
